# Answer For The World #
Ask For The World is the project built with Angular 2, Golang, MySQL and Semantic UI. 
Ask For The World provides a platform where you can create your own page to answer your friends or anyone who are curious about your experiences, values and perspectives.

## Summary ##
You have experiences, values and perspectives that you want to share and people ask about them. Let them ask on your own "Ask FTW" page and share the answers that might benefit other people.
